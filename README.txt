# README for Project 1 for CIS5371

## Overview
This project implements a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm to decrypt an encrypted message using bigram frequency analysis.

## Requirements
- Python
- NumPy library

## File Paths
- **bigram.txt**: Path to the bigram frequency file.
- **testInput.txt**: Path to the encrypted input file.

## Running the Code
1. Ensure that the file paths in the code are correct (found in lines 5 and 6).
2. Run the Python script.
3. The decrypted message and key will be printed to the console.
